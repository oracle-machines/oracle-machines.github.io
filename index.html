            <h3>Predict Everything</h1>
            <p>
                With the rise of Machine Learning, AI is finally ready to go mainstream.  
                The impact of AI will be on par with that of the internet and Electricity, 
                fundamentally changing every aspect of our lives. Despite the media hype, 
                AI is not on the verge of achieving the singularity. It is but one of the tools 
                at our disposal for solving some of the most challenging problems we face as a civilization.
                The proven techniques in AI gives algorithms a narrow expertise, they are very 
                brittle in the sense that they cannot do anything outside what they were designed to do.
                Lighting existed before the light bulb so did books before the printing press 
                but their cost was astronomically higher, you had to be careful only to use them 
                when necessary but once they became cheaper, we started using them for everything,
                drastically improving our lives. AI is doing the same for predictions.
                Predictions are a core input to our decision making process, 
                AI will assist by automating this process leaving us free to focus on the rare odd problems. 
                Also by casting problems like vision and speech recognition as prediction problems 
                computers have gained an unprecedented ability to see and hear the world around them.
                Computer Chess wasn't the death of Chess. AI will not bring about our redundancy. 
                Only by working together will be able to make the most value. 
                AI will take over the mundane and routine at scale leaving us to focus on the 
                creative and human aspects of our lives but we will still need People to supervise, 
                train and build them. Some jobs will be lost but inevitably better jobs will replace them.
